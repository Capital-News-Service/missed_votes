##Missed Votes##

**Problem:** We want to know when delegates from MD miss votes and for what reasons. It is hard to keep track of manually and by the time it is discovered or investigated, it may not be newsworthy anymore.
**Solution:** Build a Twitter bot to automatically send out a notification when every MD senator or house member puts out an excuse for a vote.
